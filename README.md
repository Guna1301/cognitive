## 🧠 Motivation

Cognitive disorders often go **undetected in early childhood**, especially in under-resourced communities. This platform aims to:

- Provide **early screening** for Autism and Dyslexia
- **Improve core cognitive skills** through games
- Be a **free, accessible solution** for parents, schools, and clinics
